# About this Guide


## The Story

I, @crashedmind, wrote this guide as part of my own "Journey to
Documentation as Code" where I landed on PlantUML and Sphinx as the main
tools for proposing, analysing, documenting, maintaining software
systems based on working with thousands of engineers across the globe.

I am a regular user of PlantUML and I believe in its current and future
potential (`Thoughts For The Future`).

I had initially contributed the OSA icon set to PlantUML Stdlib.
Specifically I generated the icon set and published it in my github. I
was pleasantly surprised that it was picked up and included in the
PlantUML Stdlib.

Some time later I was working on a project that used an Elastic stack,
and I needed the Elastic icon set for PlantUML. So I created that - and
submitted via an email and PR.

I was thinking about adding more icon sets I needed, and trying to
better understand the macros people had defined as part of their stdlib
icon sets. That's described in the "Understanding Standard Library"
section (`PlantUML Stdlib Overview`).

So, I contacted Arnaud to see if anything like this was on the roadmap.

In the subsequent 3 weeks, the idea to standardize the Stdlib was
discussed, the idea for a guide was born, and 3 weeks later the first
version of the guide was released. This 3 weeks was initially planned as
a break as I changed employer. But I enjoy playing with techie stuff,
and my thoughts were consumed by improving
[PlantUMLStdlib](https://plantuml.com/stdlib). So the 3 weeks became an
opportunity in my career to give something back to the PlantUML, and
open source community, and to learn about PlantUML.

To enable the StdLib standardisation, I suggested the *keyword
arguments* and Arnaud produced a release to play with next day - and
this became part of an official release: \* <https://plantuml.com/news>

> - 17 May, 2020: Use keyword arguments with the preprocessor
>   (V1.2020.10). (Thanks to Crashedmind for the suggestion !)\*
> - See `understandingstdlib-label` for more info.

The effort to date has led to an
[PlantUMLStdlibRFC](https://github.com/plantuml/rfc-for-standard-plantuml-stdlib),
where the PlantUML user requirements for stdlib, and the proposal will
be captured.

## Scope

The scope of the guide is the PlantUML Standard Library
([PlantUMLStdlib](https://plantuml.com/stdlib)); the Library that allows
creation of icon diagrams like those shown in
`PlantUML Diagram Examples` .

The scope is NOT the various UML-type diagrams that PlantUML is better
known for. <https://real-world-plantuml.com/> is a good resource to
learn these by example.

Skinparam has not been detailed as it is likely to change per
<https://plantuml.com/style-evolution>.

## Goals

1.  Create a user-focused guide for
    [PlantUMLStdlib](https://plantuml.com/stdlib) that enables you, the
    user, to deliver maximum value with
    [PlantUMLStdlib](https://plantuml.com/stdlib).
2.  Create a guide that was better than anything that existed and that
    I, @crashedmind, would be happy with.
3.  Grow PlantUML; this guide and other information, the tool, and the
    community.

## Principles

The Principles on which this guide are based:

1.  Deliver Value to the user
2.  Learn by Playing: The examples include a link to allow you to edit
    and play with them easily - no setup required.
3.  To teach is to learn twice.
4.  Open Source - The Network Effect - anyone can and should contribute
    to this guide.
5.  It must be fun to write it - and to read it.
6.  Documentation-Of-Code Documentation-As-Code: documentation of the
    examples, and the example source live together in the same directory
    in Git.
7.  Living Document

### Deliver Value To The User

> **💡 Tip:** "Users want powerful tools that amplify their capabilities and enable
> them to do their tasks."

> <http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/nabhcs/abstracts/shneiderman.html>

This guide is focused on enabling you to do what you need to do -
empowered by PlantUML. So it is outcome focused.

In my professional role building products in the software industry, I
tell my team members: *The customer cares about what they are trying to
do - not your product.*

This tweet illustrates this graphically:

> <https://twitter.com/UserOnboard/status/408372844876165120>

So the examples focus on what we're trying to do - and explain only the
parts of PlantUML that are necessary to do it.

### Learn by Playing

Each chapter in section "Using Standard Library" has an outcome - the
diagram(s) to be created and understood by the reader e.g.
`Create a Diagram of a Typical Network`.

Each step in each chapter has

> 1.  An outcome - the step heading
> 2.  Source code - for the diagram
> 3.  Play - where you can test the diagram and play with it.
> 4.  Explore - where you can confirm your understanding by trying
>     things as you play.

### To Teach Is To Learn [Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Joubert)

> If I knew all this info already, I would have no interest in writing
> this guide.
>
> It was the quest for knowledge that drove it, and the quest for a
> solution to a problem that consumed my thoughts (making PlantUML
> StdLib simpler, standard, and more friendly and powerful to the user
> ).
>
> There's no better way to learn than by writing a guide for others -
> and having the master on hand to provide insights as you go - and the
> community to share their knowledge.
>
> I expect to learn from feedback on this guide.

### Open Source - The Network Effect

PlantUML, and all the `Tools-label` required to write this guide are
Open Source.

Moreover, the first release is intended as a seed to be grown by the
PlantUML community.

### It Must Be Fun To Write It - And To Read It

Happy People are Productive People are Happy People!

### Documentation-Of-Code Documentation-As-Code

As part of the Agile, and Continuous Delivery, movements, software, and
the models that describe software, are necessarily coming closer
together. PlantUML is one way to enable this.

See `JourneyDOC-label` for more details.

### Living Document

The document will live and grow per `Journey to Documentation as Code`.

### Tools Used

The source for this guide, the diagrams, and the tools to create them,
all live in the same repo.

Sphinx and PlantUML (running in Docker), and GitHub, are the primary
tools used for this guide.

PlantUML source is stored in files in the same repo (as the tools and
documentation).

- The sphinx documentation source is ReStructuredText because it is more
  powerful than Markdown especially in a guide like this that references
  many source files.
- sphinxcontrib.plantuml extension allows building the plantuml diagrams
  automatically at the same time the documentation is built for html (or
  other) output.

I used Visual Studio Code, with jebbs.plantuml extension, on Kubuntu, as
my work environment.

The Sphinx and PlantUML toolchain runs on demand at build time in
Docker.

Github

- hosts the documentation and diagram source and the toolchain
  Dockerfile.

- separate repo stores the output html served via Github pages.

- GitHub actions and workflow are used e.g. when output html is
  committed, it triggers a link checker that auto-creates an Github
  issue for the project if a URL link is broken.

  > - In the future, I may move the toolchain Docker to a GitHub
  >   action+workflow so the html is built on commit.

## Credits

1.  Arnaud for giving us PlantUML. And for being receptive and
    responsive; from my initial contact asking questions, to subsequent
    interactions providing suggestions.
2.  The people who created stdlib icon sets and macros to date from
    which I learnt a lot: `PlantUML Standard Library Overview`.
3.  The active PlantUML community for asking and answering questions -
    both of which informed this guide.

## Feedback

This is an initial version; fixes and features will be added over time.

To submit feedback

- create an issue on
  <https://github.com/Crashedmind/PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide>. These will
  be reviewed and ranked periodically, and then resolved.
